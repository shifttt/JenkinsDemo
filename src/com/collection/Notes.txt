Reasons we use servers
-Always connected to the power and high speed internet
-Special layers of physical security

SDLC:
1) BA collects the requirements from the Client
software requirements specification - SRS

2) Architects will create the software design document

3) Developers develop the code on the local computers/laptops; once ready they
run test cases and once all the test cases are passed they will request the IT dep
to deploy this code to Dev Server

4) QA will request IT or devops team to deploy the code on QA servers ;
QA will verify the changes and start testing IT

5) if required application is deployed on performance and security servers.

6) Once everything is tested on QA server application is deployed on staging server

7) Once testing is completed on staging it will be deployed

8) Production server
